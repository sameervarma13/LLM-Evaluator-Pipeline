Was it possible to purchase $1 mm in SPSC shares per day without exceeding the 5% of total daily volume from September to December 31st? \n",

If there were, elaborate and give the dates. If there were at least some consecutive weeks, state how many. For simplicity assume that the daily volume amount in dollars equals the average of the open and close price multiplied by the number of shares traded. \n",

further descriptions regarding the use and calculation of non-GAAP financial measures.\\nThe annual amounts may not cross-sum due to rounding.\\nAs of April 24, 2025, the date of issuance of Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2025.\\nFinancial Data Sheets\\nSupplemental Financial Data\\nSee the previous page for the supplemental financial data, see below for descriptions regarding the use and calculation method of the information.\\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, we provide investors with Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and non-GAAP income per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. \\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to our management, Board of Directors, and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition \\nand results of operations.\\nOur management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is also used for purposes of determining \\nexecutive and senior management incentive compensation. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to an investor as they are widely used in evaluating operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and \\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin are used to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, \\nand to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\\n \\n \\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of net income adjusted for income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, realized gain or loss from foreign currency on cash \\nand investments held, investment income, and other adjustments as necessary for a fair presentation.1 Net income is the comparable GAAP measure of financial performance.\\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin consists of Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Margin, the comparable GAAP measure of financial performance, consists of net income divided by revenue. \\nNon-GAAP income per share consists of net income adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense related to intangible assets, realized gain or loss from foreign currency on cash \\nand investments held, other adjustments as necessary for a fair presentation,1  and the corresponding tax impacts of the adjustments to net income, divided by the weighted average number of shares of \\ncommon and diluted stock outstanding during each period. Net income per share, the comparable GAAP measure of financial performance, consists of net income divided by the weighted average number \\nof shares of common and diluted stock outstanding during each period. To quantify the tax effects, we recalculated income tax expense excluding the direct book and tax effects of the specific items \\nconstituting the non-GAAP adjustments. The difference between this recalculated income tax expense and GAAP income tax expense is presented as the income tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments.\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant expenses \\nand income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations. Investors should review the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures to the comparable GAAP financial measures that are included in this financial data sheet.\\n1 See corresponding filings with the SEC (Form 10-K or Form 10-Q) for further detail on other adjustments included in non-GAAP financial measures.\\nFinancial Data Sheets\\nStatements of Cash Flows\\n(Unaudited; in
